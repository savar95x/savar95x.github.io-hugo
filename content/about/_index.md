# About Me
<img class=round-image align="right" src="/imgs/me/sit.jpg" style="margin-left: clamp(1rem, 5vw, 1.5rem);" />
My name is <span class=highlight2>Savar</span> (səːvə, सवर). I am a fourth year undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science at IIT Madras. I have a deep passion for natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a> training, am an avid <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software</a> and linux enthusiast, and a cinema lover.  

During my leisure hours, I often find myself working on this website or on my <a href=https://github.com/savar95x/dotfiles>rice</a>. Apart from that, I spend time trying to understand various training methodologies and philosophies in natural bodybuilding.  

I started this blog as a platform to express my thoughts, articulate my ideas, and hopefully find solace through the process of writing.
