**In Works**  

Consume > 1.6 x (Bodyweight in KGs) protein
For example, I am 70 kg, so I should consume 1.6 x 70 ~ 112 g protein.  

For calories, calculate your maintenance [here](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) and eat in a slight surplus (100~200 cal). Never be in a deficit as a beginner. But always fill your calories with clean food.  
No need to track carbs and fat also, just make you're well fed and energized before a workout.  

For micro-nutrients, again no need to think very thoroughly, if you're consuming good amounts of vegetables like in an Indian diet it should be fine.  

*Eat Clean*  
For pimples, or bad gut health, drink plenty water, walk a lot, avoid inflammatory foods like kfc, and include anti-oxidant/inflammatory foods like cranberries.  
Nuts, seeds, fruits and veggies.  


TODO: huberman lab salt and condense it here.  
also, go through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mnLRQsrs9k) and write imp stuff.
