I've written this from the perspective of a student, with a limited budget.  

The most cost efficient and complete protein source will be eggs. I cosume 10 eggs everyday which give me around ~60g and costs me 100 rs.  
The rest is done using chicken and soya chunks. I personally have a tiffin service which is where I get my chicken from and costs me ~200/day and gives around 40g protein, but you can do it cheaper. And soya chunks are cheap to begin with.  

This in total costs me ~300/day and gives me ~120gms of protein. I have also taken mess so the rest of the calories get completed using rice and chapati.
