As a newcomer to lifting weights, the first goal should be to learn and get good at the basic movement patterns.  
- Pulling
    - A Vertical Pull (like Pullups)
    - A Horizontal Pull or a Row (like Barbell Rows)
- Pushing
    - A Horizontal Push (like Pushups)
    - An Overhead Press (like standing barbell overhead press).
- Legs
    - A Squat Pattern
    - A Hip-Hinge (like Deadlifts)

Most people just wanna look good and feel strong, just getting stronger at the basics along with some isolation work should do that.  

## Sample program
If you wanna just get started, which is what this page aims to do, here is a sample workout for beginners that incorporates all the basic movement patterns mentioned above.  

| **Push** (Mon) | **Pull** (Wed) | **Legs** (Fri) |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Barbell Bench Press | Wide Grip Pulldown | Squats |
| Dumbbell Lateral Raises | Cable Row | Leg Curl |
| Tricep Pushdown | Bicep Curl | Leg Extensions |  
| Tricep Overhead Extension | Hammer Curl | Calf Raises |
|  | Reverse Pec Deck | |

<span class=note-box>
Don't focus on putting too much weight on the bar as a beginner, as you don't really know the proper form and may injure yourself.  
</span>
This phase should help you to overcome feeling like an impostor in the gym and help you overcome the anxiety of being in a new environment.  

## Basic Movements
Here are short but detailed video tutorials for the six basic movement patterns.

## Isolations
Most of your mass will come from compounds, so always prioritise them, but isolations are still necessary for building a well rounded physique.

<span class="note-box">Perform each of the mentioned exercises in the sample program for 2-3 sets per week for now.</span>

Keep in mind, you should have as good of a form as you possibly can, while training till muscular failure. It'll be hard in the beginning to achieve that, but <span class=highlight>training to failure is a skill</span>, which will improve the more you try to do it.  

Focus on learning how to perform the movements as perfect as humanly possible. Your central nervous system and muscles will learn how to do the movement and your structure will know how to work as one unit in harmony, and within a month or two you'll have a really good form.</span>

In the following sections, we delve deeper into muscle anatomy and movement patterns.
