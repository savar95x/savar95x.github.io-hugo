Really common vocabulary that gym goers use.  
## Gym
A place of physical wellbeing. One could use this to pursue various goals such as more muscle mass or strength, cardiovascular strength, plyometrics, sports like crossfit, or health in general to name a few. In this article, we'll only be discussing the size and strength aspect of it.  

## Reps / Repetitions
The number of times you perform a movement at once. For example, 10 reps of bicep curl.  

## Sets
The number of distinct groups of consecutive reps performed without resting. For example, 3 sets of bicep curl. Between each set, you take 2-5 minutes of rest and each set might consist of 8-12 reps.
