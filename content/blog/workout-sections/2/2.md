# Introduction
This section explores how to train a muscle group based on its functions.  
- **Push**   
    - [Chest](#chest)   
    - [Front Delt](#anterior-delt)   
    - [Tricep](#tricep)   
- **Pull**   
    - [Back](#back)   
    - [Bicep](#bicep)   
    - [Rear Delt](#rear-delt)   
- **Legs**  
    - [Quads](#quadriceps)   
    - [Hams](#hamstrings)   
    - [Glutes](glutes-maximus)   
    - [Calves](#calves)   
# Chest
The Main function of the chest is to press.  
## Chest Press
Movements like the barbell bench press, dips etc come over here, where we're pressing the weight using our chest muscles.  
Getting stronger at these builds the majority of the chest.  
- barbell/db flat/incline bench press
- dips
- pushups

Chest also as a function of adducting the arms, which is what a flye does.  
## Flyes
- cable flyes
- cross overs
- pec deck

# Anterior Delt
It serves similar fuctions as the chest.  
- bb/db ohp seated/standing 
- pike/handstand pushups
Some isolations are also there but not worth the time in my opinion.  

# Tricep
Main function is to extend the elbow.

But since the long head also passes through the shoulder joint, we can categorise extending in two ways
## Pushdowns
Where the arms are (typically) in front of the body, and we're extending down.  
These bias the lateral and medial heads, but it doesn't mean it won't work the long head. All tricep movements work all the three heads.  
- rope / straight bar / v bar cable pushdowns
- jm press
- you get the point, people get creative
## Overhead Extensions
Where the arm is overhead and the lond head is pre-stretched.  
- skull crushers
- cable overhead extensions (rope/bar)
- db overhead extension
- etc etc.

Note that pulling movement like pullups and pullovers will also work the long head a bit, but we don't count that as direct work.  

# Back
Mainly two fundamental movements
## Pulldowns
Vertical pulls. Typically bias more of the lats, teres major/minor etc.
- pulldowns
- pullups

You can play with the width (narrow, wide, extra wide) and the grip orientation (pronated, supinated, neutral)
## Rows
Horizontal pull. Usually bias more of the middle/lower traps, rhomboids, midback region.  
- barbell rows
- db rows
- machine rows

While training back, many beginners have trouble pulling with the back and having a connection with it. To fix that, try leading the pull with your elbow, instead of pulling with your arm. Think of your hand/forearm as hook.  

# Bicep 
Bicep's main function is to curl and to supinate the wrist. Just doing any sort of curl should work.  
- ezbar/barbell curl
- db curl
- preacher curl
- etc.

# Rear delt
Here we have a lot of options, doing just one should suffice
