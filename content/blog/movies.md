I'd recommend everyone to watch these at least once in their lifetimes.

The story of the baseball legend Jackie Robinson's journey starting out in the MLB, highlighting the racism in the sport. All the leads have done phenomenal acting, and this is a movie you won't forget anytime soon.  
Fun Fact - This is the movie that earned Chadwick Boseman his role as Black Panther, and rightfully so. May he rest in peace.

I think I speak for the majority when I say this is *one of the greatest* web series you'll ever experience.  
The storytelling, character development, animation, dialogues, score - everything is done masterfully. And with a total runtime of 12 hours, it just feels like a long, well-made, engaging movie.  
I honestly feel grateful to witness it in my lifetime, and I am yet to encounter another series that moves me as much as Arcane does.

I love how Scorsese directed this. Everything unfolds as it should, keeping the watcher engaged all the time - even during rewatches.  
If you wanna get your mind blown, this is the way.

This one-of-a-kind movie celebrates individuality, free thinking, and the importance of seizing the moment, all while critiquing conformity and societal pressures.  
A simple yet impactful story that inspires and resonates deeply.
