I'd recommend everyone to watch these at least once in their lifetimes.

<h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 0.25rem 0;">42 (2013)</h2>
<p class=small-caps-text style="color: var(--clr-gray);margin: 0.1em 0 0 0;">added on <span class=highligh>07 Feb, 2025</span></p>

The story of the baseball legend Jackie Robinson's journey starting out in the MLB, highlighting the racism in the sport. All the leads have done phenomenal acting, and this is a movie you won't forget anytime soon.

Fun fact - This is the movie that earned Chadwick Boseman his role as Black Panther, and rightfully so. May he rest in peace.

<h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 0.25rem 0;">Arcane (2021)</h2>
<p class=small-caps-text style="color: var(--clr-gray);margin: 0.1em 0 0 0;">added on <span class=highligh>18 Jan, 2025</span></p>

I think I speak for the majority when I say this is <span class=highlight>one of the greatest</span> web series you'll ever experience.

The storytelling, character development, animation, dialogues, score - everything is done masterfully. And with a total runtime of 12 hours, it just feels like a long, well-made, engaging movie.  
I honestly feel grateful to witness it in my lifetime, and I am yet to encounter another series that moves me as much as Arcane does.

<h2 style="margin: 2rem 0 0.25rem 0;">Shutter Island (2010)</h2>
<p class=small-caps-text style="color: var(--clr-gray);margin: 0.1em 0 0 0;">added on <span class=highligh>18 Jan, 2025</span></p>

I love how Scorsese directed this. Everything unfolds as it should, keeping the watcher engaged all the time - even during rewatches.

I've always had a soft spot for this movie. <s>It goes into the topic of finding one's true passion, realising what you're really meant to do in this world, and what you might have to overco.....</s>  
It's a good movie, and you should watch it. You'll either love it to the core, or consider it another overrated mediocre relic of the past; be your own judge.
