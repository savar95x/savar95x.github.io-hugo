I follow a Push, Pull, Leg split.  
If you're here to learn as a beginner, I'd redirect you to [here](/blog/workout-beginners/).  

## Push
- **Chest:** Barbell Bench Press
- **Side Delts:** Lateral Raises (Cable/Dumbbell)
- **Tricep:** Pushdown, Overhead Extensions (both Cable)

## Pull
- **Back:** Wide grip Pulldown, Barbell Bent Over Row
- **Bicep:** Curls, Hammer Curls (both Cable)
- **Rear Delts:** Reverse Pec Deck

## Legs
- **Quads:** Squats
- **Hammies:** Leg Curl

The way I structure my week is;  
Push, Pull, Leg, Rest.  
And then I repeat.
