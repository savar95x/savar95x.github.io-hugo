I follow a push, pull, leg inspired split.  
If you're here to learn as a beginner, I'd redirect you to [here](/blog/workout-beginners/).  

## Push (chest, biceps, front and side delts)
- Seated DB Overhead Press ss Preacher Curl
- Incline DB Press ss Preacher Curl
- Lateral Raises SS Hammer curls
- Hanging Knee Raises

No overhead pressing for now.  

## Pull (back, triceps, rear delt)
- Neutral Grip Cable High Row / Conventional Deadlifts (alternate)
- Neutral Grip Pulldown SS Skull Crushers
- DB Rows
- V-Bar Tricep Pushdown SS Reverse Pec Deck

## Legs (quads, hamstrings)
- Squats
- Leg Curls
- Obliques

No direct calf work, rather I try to get in ~10k steps everyday, which is the only cardio I do in a day.  

SS means superset. No direct work for neck or forearms right now.  
Every movement is failed in the 5-10 rep range. And performed for 2-4 sets, depending on how I feel that day.  
Rest days are flexible depending on how I feel and clashes with other responsibilities.
